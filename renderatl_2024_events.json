      "description": "Over the past decade, Slack has evolved from a simple, game-changing team communication tool to a much larger, and let’s admit it more complex, team communication tool. Where there was once just direct messages and channels, there are now apps, shared channels, canvases, workflows, and, of course, AI. Even if you’re a long time Slack user, you may not be getting everything you can from Slack. In this session, we’re going to assume you are familiar with Slack and excited to learn more about how you can make your own, and your team’s, working lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. While this session will touch on administering Slack workspaces, it is not a comprehensive overview of how to administer Slack and is primarily designed for end users of Slack\n\nRegister for this workshop by visiting your ticket details (if applicable).",

We’ll cover the basics, as well as TypeScript’s biggest features: generics, conditional types, discriminated unions, etc, but always from a real world, practical perspective. Devs who’ve never touched TypeScript will leave with solid fundamentals, comfortable (and hopefully eager!) to start using it at work—but devs who’ve used it a bit will still learn a lot.

Then we’ll get to work, and charge into a real-world introduction to TypeScript. We’ll cover the basics, as well as TypeScript’s biggest features: generics, conditional types, discriminated unions, etc, but always from a real world, practical perspective. Devs who’ve never touched TypeScript will leave with solid fundamentals, comfortable (and hopefully eager!) to start using it at work—but devs who’ve used it a bit will still learn a lot.

But wouldn’t it be more fun to run JS natively, without the browser, with unlimited access to this new platform capabilities of spatial computing? Yes it would! And thanks to React Native it turned out easier than I thought (yet still very challenging). And with this talk I want to share my journey and ideas for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong description\r\n\r\nI want to take the audience through a journey of adding a new platform, such as Apple’s visionOS, to React Native – where to start, and how to help yourself progressing through layers of tooling and complexity and release for other developers to use. React Native being an amazing piece of engineering, is a complex, 8-years-in-the-making project that builds on a variety of OSS tooling, including Hermes JS engine, Cocoapods, but also its own C++ code generation, new architecture, and much more. I will also discuss how we enhance React Native itself by introducing modern APIs, adding multi-screen support to iPadOS and macOS Catalyst apps, fixing bugs, and making it way easier for other new platforms to integrate seamlessly. I will also discuss how we implemented visionOS specific APIs like: `ImmersiveScenes`, `3DModel` and how you can use 3D rendering to enhance your user's experience. And how we plan to go beyond Apple Vision Pro.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "How can organizations build high performing and diverse teams that can thrive in today's complex and dynamic environment? This is the question that this presentation will address, drawing on the real-life examples and experience of building such organizations over 15 years at Microsoft. \r\n\r\nHigh performing teams achieve superior results, while maintaining high levels of satisfaction and engagement among their members. Such teams are also those that can adapt and innovate in response to changing demands and opportunities. To achieve this, teams need to have a clear and shared purpose, a high degree of trust and collaboration, psychological safety, and a supportive and empowering culture.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not simple to create diverse and high performing teams. It demands deliberate and ongoing actions from team leaders and team members alike, to deal with the issues and obstacles that may emerge. Some challenges and barriers are: different cultures and mindsets, prejudices and assumptions, unconscious biases, difficulties in communicating, and fear.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will offer some practical strategies and tools to help team leaders and team members to build high-performance and diverse teams, based on four key principles:\r\n- Create Clarity: Team leaders and members need to synthesize complex data and insights, ensure shared understanding of the team's vision, goals, and roles, define and execute a course of action, and measure and celebrate success.\r\n- Generate Energy: Team leaders and team members need to foster a positive and constructive mindset, and to encourage and appreciate new ideas and perspectives. They also need to promote a culture of learning and feedback, and to help each other develop new skills and capabilities.\r\n- Deliver Success: To create value for customers and stakeholders, team leaders and members need to deliver what they want and expect. They need to try new things and learn from users and the market. They also need to be curious and passionate, and to encourage and excite each other to achieve excellence and impact.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, building high performing and diverse teams is a key factor for organizational success. This presentation will provide some insights and examples on how to achieve this, and how to overcome the challenges and barriers that may arise.\r\n",

      "description": "“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”. Today’s technological landscape is marked by rapid advancements, from awe-inspiring artificial intelligence to captivating 3D graphics and highly advanced simulations. At the heart of these innovations lies the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) – the workhorse driving modern computation. \r\n\r\nSpanning a wide array of platforms – from palm-sized mobile devices to vast data centers – GPUs have become a solid foundation for innovation, enabling technology that truly feels like magic. But there are no arcane spellweavers inhabiting our computational devices. Only cleverly authored bits and bytes running on specialized architecture. \r\n\r\nHowever, while GPUs are everywhere, fully leveraging their capabilities remains a complex puzzle for many developers. Navigating the vendor-specific API landscape and mastering parallel programming is a daunting task. Nevertheless, with the advent of the upcoming WebGPU API bringing high-performance computing to the web, and the success of modern APIs such as Vulkan and CUDA, the era of computationally demanding products is already upon us. Making it the perfect time to learn the fundamentals of GPU programming. \r\n\r\nLearning objectives:\r\n- Learn the fundamentals of parallel programming and how to avoid common pitfalls.\r\n- Understand the general architecture of modern GPUs.\r\n- Understand the role of Vulkan as a modern GPU API\r\n- Understand the role of WebGPU as a low-level API that exposes modern GPU APIs directly to the browser.\r\n- Learn how to set up, optimize, and initiate GPU computations in WebGPU.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, attendees will have a foundational understanding of GPU architectures, the role of WebGPU and Vulkan, and the basics of writing GPU-accelerated code. Join the quest to unravel the potential of GPUs – no magic wand required.\r\n",

Even when you have a perfect connection, anything that depends on server state is going to have some sort of delay. End-users will tell you that spinner fatigue is real! The cloud tax is a major drag on developers, too; even very simple app ideas require provisioning infrastructure, sophisticated networking code, and so many other complexities that would melt away if only you could just worry about whatever data is on disk. Local-first architecture is a paradigm for keeping the primary working copy of app data on the user's device rather than the cloud, syncing those changes without conflicts, even when devices are offline for a long time. Let’s get familiar with “LoFi,” how it’s a win for users and developers, and some new tools that streamline building local-first cross-platform React apps.",

      "description": "Recent advances in Generative AI, specifically in large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the field of natural language processing and have taken the \"AI Hype\" to an extreme. LLMs have the potential to become a backbone that supports the growth and development of numerous industries. Their versatility and adaptability make them powerful tools for innovation and problem-solving. \r\nAt the same time, there is growing unease around whether the behavior of these systems can be rendered transparent, explainable, unbiased, and accountable. \r\nBetter and cheaper algorithms and data are required in tandem; however, AI is different from other technologies because it learns. In essence, it provides prediction, a way of managing uncertainty, and creating value by improving decision-making. \r\nIt's still in the early days, but the use of Generative AI is already widespread. It can substantially increase labor productivity across the economy:\r\n•\tAugmenting the capabilities of individual workers\r\n•\tAutomating some of their activities\r\nWhen Generative AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value created. Moreover, augmentation creates new capabilities, products, and services, ultimately generating far more value than merely human-like AI. It can lower the cost of exploration and accelerate hands-on experimentation, feedback, and iterative progress. However, we've just started learning how to work with them.\r\nProduct leaders, software engineers, application developers, and technology entrepreneurs must make effective decisions to leverage and embed Generative AI in their products, applications, and businesses. \r\nUnderstanding how AI differs from other technologies and its critical success factors can make or break their endeavors.\r\nIn this idea exchange and networking conversation, a CTO turned entrepreneur presents a practitioner's perspective, illustrative examples, and lessons learned prototyping an \"expert AI assistant\" for a stealth tech start-up company. Some of the key challenges and critical success factors discussed are:\r\n1.   It's challenging to contemplate new system design opportunities. Valuable AI-based products streamline minimum essential decisions, considering high-fidelity prediction machines are available.\r\n2.   First-mover advantages depend on how good the prediction needs to be to enter the market (minimum viable predictions).\r\n3.   Early adoption of Generative AI is not necessarily a moat if the prediction does not improve with time. The advantage isn't launching first; it's launching by collecting feedback data. Improving prediction with feedback data creates a race between competitors. It might be impossible to catch up to a competitor that falls behind.\r\n4.   AI use cases appeal to different groups or businesses, so domain knowledge is vital. Many AI systems are only differentiated by quality (a term that requires a precise definition depending on the use case).\r\n5.   Measuring discrimination by machine is straightforward, while doing the same with humans is hard.\r\nJoin this conversation! It's a work in progress; we're making history, and no opinions are final!",

Improving prediction with feedback data creates a race between competitors. It might be impossible to catch up to a competitor that falls behind.\r\n4.   AI use cases appeal to different groups or businesses, so domain knowledge is vital. Many AI systems are only differentiated by quality (a term that requires a precise definition depending on the use case).\r\n5.   Measuring discrimination by machine is straightforward while doing the same with humans is hard."

      "description": "Generative AI (GenAI) applications are known to “hallucinate,” or confidently respond with false or made-up information. Hallucinations are one of the biggest drawbacks to using this tech and are also famously hard to detect, prevent, and fix. But, researchers and engineers are racing to solve this problem as GenAI adoption increases. \r\n\r\nSo, for a DevOps team adopting this tech now, what’s the best way to tell when hallucinations happen, and most importantly, why?\r\n\r\nEngineers, and the company’s bottom line, need a way to trace the path of the response—from the user’s prompt and integration with a large language model (LLM) to work by agents, API calls, and back to the end user. By monitoring every step, engineers can learn where hallucinations originate and apply a potential fix, like adding more context to the prompt or ensuring the LLM is re-summarizing responses accurately, so they can quickly take action and improve the quality of their results. \r\n\r\nIn this session, Jemiah Sius, Senior Director of Developer Relations at New Relic will explain how companies can use observability to help prevent GenAI hallucinations and share ways DevOps teams can improve their LLM integrations with context, agents, chained models, and more—with a focus on how to do it affordably.\r\n\r\nIn his role, Jemiah leads a global team focused on solving friction points for engineering teams—keeping them at the center of New Relic’s innovation strategy—so they can more easily find and fix issues before they impact their business and customers. \r\n\r\nWith that, he understands the challenges DevOps teams face and how, if deployed strategically, GenAI solutions can help solve those challenges.\r\n",

Traditional methods, like presenting a physical ID, are not feasible for online transactions. And sharing complete personal details like date of birth online can compromise privacy.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Angie Jones was able to use her mobile driver’s license application to share a special JSON Web Token (JWT), known as a Verifiable Credential (VC), to digitally prove to both the vendor and the delivery company that she is of legal drinking age. \r\n\r\nAdhering to W3C open standards, VCs offer a streamlined, privacy-centric method to digitally verify just about any qualification including identity,  employment, education, residency, and so much more! \r\n\r\nJoin Angie Jones for a practical demonstration of creating and sharing tamper-resistant digital credentials in the form of JWTs.

The first section of the talk will cover the architecture of JamStack, including its key principles and benefits. We will also discuss the early open-source projects and companies that were building the JamStack tool kit. Once the audience has a baseline understanding of JamStack, we will move on to discussing where we are today with JamStack architecture. We will explore how the principles of JamStack have remained the same, even as modern frameworks such as Next, Astro, and Remix have pushed the envelope on what was initially a static website development approach. JamStack's embrace of dynamic responses for responsive websites empowers developers to create engaging user experiences. With the advent of AI-driven development, future-proofing your webstack is even more critical.",

      "description": "Nowadays, there are many attack vectors an adversary can employ to either break into the system or impact its operations. Oftentimes a successful attack is a clever combination of smaller vectors, which on their own do not seem very important or dangerous. That’s why to efficiently mitigate modern Internet threats the system should be built with the “defense in depth” in mind.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will discuss the various approaches and technical solutions Cloudflare implemented to protect infrastructure and services from the biggest Internet threats. We will review a layered approach to security starting from the Internet itself, then data center networking, server and operating systems layers, application and service layers. We will see how the Internet today has become the global “security perimeter” and how to protect modern cloud workloads and corporate services.",

Prior to A-Frame, Avantha ran her own consulting practice helping scores of founders land on their feet and large companies innovate. She has also previously led and grown operations at Gerber Technology, Avametric, TATCHA, and Tufts University Research and other companies across beauty, CPG, and tech. As a trans woman of color, she is passionate about innovating the way organizations think, build, create, and grow – placing DEI at the forefront of every business decision. Notably, Avantha was named to Fast Company’s 2022 Queer 50 List, celebrating LGBTQ women and nonbinary innovators in business and tech. She is a former Human Behavioral Fellow, finalist for Most Indispensable Organization Organizer in the Bay, named Rising Thought Leader in Talent in 2016, and led people operations for Inc Magazine’s Fastest-Growing Private Company in San Francisco in 2015.",

In my free time I try to delve into a range of interests such as fitness, beauty, fashion, video games, home decor, tennis (although I'm trash) and so much more.\r\n\r\nI worked in the retail industry for several years starting in sales before making a transition into the world of buying. However, as a black woman navigating the intricate landscapes of corporate fashion, I encountered the challenges of limited representation and diversity in the industry amongst other things.\r\n\r\nI decided to chart a new course for myself and embarked on the very difficult journey of attending a software engineering boot camp. The transition from the fashion realm to the tech world was both exciting and inspiring. Although very difficult I managed to land a job at Datadog as a Solutions Engineer. This role is very heavily DevOps focused which I learned nothing about in bootcamp but I've gained so much knowledge through my work. Excited to see what's next in my journey in tech because I finally feel I'm where I belong.",
